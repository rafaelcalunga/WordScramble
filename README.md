#  Word Scramble

This app is a game, it selects a world and you have to come up another valid word using the letters of the select word

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Manipulate Lists in SwiftUI
- Use List, Bundle, UITextChecker
- Mix dynamic and static lists
- Load resources from the app bundle
- Add compatibility with older Objective-C
- Validate words with UITextChecker

This app was made using the course "100 Days of SwiftUI" from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
